# 🔐 Linux Security Audit – Simulated Project

## Overview
As part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I conducted a file and directory permission audit in a simulated corporate environment. The goal was to align file access with security policy by restricting unauthorized write or execute access.

---

## 🔎 Objectives
- Analyze file and directory permissions in a target directory using `ls -la`
- Understand and interpret permission strings
- Apply least privilege principle to sensitive files and folders
- Use `chmod` to enforce correct access controls

---

## 🗂️ Key Tasks Performed

### ✅ 1. Checked File & Directory Details
Used:
```bash
ls -la ~/projects
```
- Reviewed file types, owners, and permission sets.
- Identified files needing permission corrections (e.g. `project_k.txt`, `.project_x.txt`, `drafts/`).

---

### ✅ 2. Interpreted Permission Strings
Example:  
```
-rw-rw-r--  project_t.txt
```
- `-` : Regular file  
- `rw-` : User has read/write  
- `rw-` : Group has read/write  
- `r--` : Others can only read  

---

### ✅ 3. Modified File Permissions
#### 🔧 Remove write permission from "others" for `project_k.txt`:
```bash
chmod o-w project_k.txt
```

#### 🔧 Update `.project_x.txt` (hidden file):
```bash
chmod u-w .project_x.txt
chmod g-w .project_x.txt
chmod g+r .project_x.txt
```
- No write permissions for user or group.
- Group can only read.
- Others have no access.

---

### ✅ 4. Secured Directory Access (`drafts/`)
Goal: Only `researcher2` should have execute (access) rights.
```bash
chmod g-x drafts/
```
- Removed execute permission for group.
- Ensured only `researcher2` retained execute access to the `drafts` directory.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- `ls -la`
- `chmod`
- Linux terminal (Ubuntu CLI)

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to read, interpret, and correct Linux file permission strings.
- When and why to apply least privilege to files.
- Safe use of `chmod` in multi-user environments.
- Importance of directory execute permissions for access control.

---

## 📂 Repo Contents
- `audit-report.md`: (Optional) Description of permission changes
- `chmod-commands.txt`: All commands used in sequence
- `before-after.txt`: Example outputs before and after changes
